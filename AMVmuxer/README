About building ffmpeg for AMV encoding (leonier's fork)
If you intended to use MinGW (GCC 6+), please use these build options.

Install libfaad2 first for AAC decoding.
 ./configure --enable-memalign-hack --disable-ffplay --enable-gpl --enable-swscaler --enable-libfaad

Building with mingw-w64 (mingw32 mode) may also work. 

Testing instructions ;)

Make sure you've got a fresh copy of the sourcecode:

$ svn update

Compile the patched FFmpeg - AMV-support is now build in:
$ make build

Grab sample files (hole.avi and hole_correct.amv) from 
http://code.google.com/p/amv-codec-tools/downloads/list
and put them to this directory.

Test it by converting the testvideo hole.avi to hole.amv:

$ make test

Now compare this to the correct hole_correct.amv and fix those bugs !
